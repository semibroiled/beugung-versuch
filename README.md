### Abstract 

The purpose of this project is to create functions to quickly and efficiently calculate _wavelength_ and _distance_ measurements in accordance to the 
__Beugung O5__ experiment and questionaire. 

### Introduction

#### The Physics to the Madness

The _formulae_ that makes up the basis of our bulk of calculations are;

1. ___sin(theta) = (N*Lambda) / G___ ; where _theta_ is the curvature angle, _lambda_ is the wavelength, _N_ is the Order Number and _G_ is the Matrix Constant
2. ___tan(theta) = (D_k / D)___; where _theta_ is the same curvature angle as used in ___(1)___, _D_k_ is the distance from the 0th to the k-th Maxima on the projection and _D_ is the distance from the Matrix to the Projection Screen
